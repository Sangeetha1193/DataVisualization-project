# **YouTube Channel Data Visualization project**
Welcome! This project dives deep into the world of popular YouTube channels, uncovering trends based on subscribers, content categories, and countries. Using a blend of Python for analysis and Tableau for visual storytelling, I explored what drives viewership and subscriber growth across different genres and regions.

## **Project Overview**

This analysis explores key questions like:

Which content categories attract the most subscribers?

Do branded channels perform better than non-branded ones?

How does geography influence subscriber distribution?

Combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations, the project delivers insights using both Python and Tableau.

## **Tech Stack**
**Python (Jupyter / Scripts)**

pandas – for data wrangling and cleaning

seaborn & matplotlib – for static visualizations

**Tableau**

Interactive dashboards

Geo maps and treemaps for visual insights

**Git & GitHub**

Version control and project hosting

## **Key Visualizations**

Here’s what was explored:

Bar Charts – Subscriber comparison across content categories

Heatmaps – Correlation between channel types and subscriber count

Scatter Plots – Brand vs Non-Brand performance

Geo Maps – Country-wise channel distribution

Treemaps – Category impact on subscriber numbers

## **Tableau Dashboard Highlights**

🌍 Global View – Channel performance across countries

🏷️ Brand vs Non-Brand – Are branded channels more successful?

🎭 Category Breakdown – Which genres dominate YouTube?

🔄 Interactive Filters – Explore data by country, language, and content category

## Lessons Learned

Gained hands-on experience in data cleaning and transformation

Mastered Python visualization techniques

Built insightful, interactive dashboards in Tableau

Improved storytelling through data

## Future Enhancements

Add time-series analysis to track subscriber growth over time

Include viewer engagement metrics like watch time and likes
